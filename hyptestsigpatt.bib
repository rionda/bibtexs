	abstract = {Abstract Knowledge discovery methods often discover a large number of patterns. Although this can be considered of interest, it certainly presents considerable challenges too. Indeed, this set of patterns often contains lots of uninteresting patterns that risk overwhelming the data miner. In addition, a single interesting pattern can be discovered in a multitude of tiny variations that for all practical purposes are redundant. These issues are referred to as the pattern explosion problem. They lie at the basis of much recent research attempting to quantify interestingness and redundancy between patterns, with the purpose of filtering down a large pattern set to an interesting and compact subset. Many diverse approaches to interestingness and corresponding interestingness measures (IMs) have been proposed in the literature. Some of them, named objective IMs, define interestingness only based on objective criteria of the pattern and data at hand. Subjective IMs additionally depend on the user's prior knowledge about the dataset. Formalizing unexpectedness is probably the most common approach for defining subjective IMs, where a pattern is deemed unexpected if it contradicts the user's expectations about the dataset. Such subjective IMs based on unexpectedness form the focus of this paper. We categorize measures based on unexpectedness into two major subgroups, namely, syntactical and probabilistic approaches. Based on this distinction, we survey different methods for assessing the unexpectedness of patterns with a special focus on frequent itemsets, tiles, association rules, and classification rules. {\copyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	volume = {30},
	year = {2015},
	abstract = {As increasingly complex hypothesis-testing scenarios are considered in many scientific fields, analytic derivation of null distributions is often out of reach. To the rescue comes Monte Carlo testing, which may appear deceptively simple: as long as you can sample test statistics under the null hypothesis, the p-value is just the proportion of sampled test statistics that exceed the observed test statistic. Sampling test statistics is often simple once you have a Monte Carlo null model for your data, and defining some form of randomization procedure is also, in many cases, relatively straight-forward. However, there may be several possible choices of a randomization null model for the data and no clear-cut criteria for choosing among them. Obviously, different null models may lead to very different p-values, and a very low p-value may thus occur due to the inadequacy of the chosen null model. It is preferable to use assumptions about the underlying random data generation process to guide selection of a null model. In many cases, we may order the null models by increasing preservation of the data characteristics, and we argue in this paper that this ordering in most cases gives increasing p-values, that is, lower significance. We denote this as the null complexity principle. The principle gives a better understanding of the different null models and may guide in the choice between the different models.},

	title = {Selective Inference Approach for Statistically Sound Predictive Pattern Mining},
	year = {2016},
	abstract = {Discovering statistically significant patterns from databases is an important challenging problem. The main obstacle of this problem is in the difficulty of taking into account the selection bias, i.e., the bias arising from the fact that patterns are selected from extremely large number of candidates in databases. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for predictive pattern mining problems that can address the selection bias issue. Our approach is built on a recently popularized statistical inference framework called selective inference. In selective inference, statistical inferences (such as statistical hypothesis testing) are conducted based on sampling distributions conditional on a selection event. If the selection event is characterized in a tractable way, statistical inferences can be made without minding selection bias issue. However, in pattern mining problems, it is difficult to characterize the entire selection process of mining algorithms. Our main contribution in this paper is to solve this challenging problem for a class of predictive pattern mining problems by introducing a novel algorithmic framework. We demonstrate that our approach is useful for finding statistically significant patterns from databases.},

We study the novel problem of finding the smallest set of patterns that explains most about the data in terms of a global p value. The resulting set of patterns, such as frequent patterns or clusterings, is the smallest set that statistically explains the data. We show that the newly formulated problem is, in its general form, NP-hard and there exists no efficient algorithm with finite approximation ratio. However, we show that in a special case a solution can be computed efficiently with a provable approximation ratio. We find that a greedy algorithm gives good results on real data and that, using our approach, we can formulate and solve many known data-mining tasks. We demonstrate our method on several data mining tasks. We conclude that our framework is able to identify in various settings a small set of patterns that statistically explains the data and to formulate data mining problems in the terms of statistical significance.},

	year = {2009},
	abstract = {There is a wide variety of data mining methods available, and it is generally useful
in exploratory data analysis to use many different methods for the same dataset. This,
however, leads to the problem of whether the results found by one method are a reflection
of the phenomenon shown by the results of another method, or whether the results depict
in some sense unrelated properties of the data. For example, using clustering can
give indication of a clear cluster structure, and computing correlations between variables
can show that there are many significant correlations in the data. However, it can
be the case that the correlations are actually determined by the cluster structure.In
this paper, we consider the problem of randomizing data so that previously discovered
patterns or models are taken into account. The randomization methods can be used in
iterative data mining. At each step in the data mining process, the randomization
produces random samples from the set of data matrices satisfying the already discovered
patterns or models. That is, given a data set and some statistics (e.g., cluster centers
or co-occurrence counts) of the data, the randomization methods sample data sets having
similar values of the given statistics as the original data set. We use Metropolis
sampling based on local swaps to achieve this. We describe experiments on real data
that demonstrate the usefulness of our approach. Our results indicate that in many
cases, the results of, e.g., clustering actually imply the results of, say, frequent
pattern discovery.},

Traditional association rules do not capture the idea of statistical dependence and the resulting rules can be spurious, while the most significant rules may be missing. This leads to erroneous models and predictions which often become expensive. The problem is computationally very difficult, because the significance is not a monotonic property. However, in this paper, we prove several other properties, which can be used for pruning the search space. The properties are implemented in the StatApriori algorithm, which searches statistically significant, non-redundant association rules. Empirical experiments have shown that StatApriori is very efficient, but in the same time it finds good quality rules.},

	abstract = {α-investing is an adaptive sequential methodology that encompasses a large family of procedures for testing multiple hypotheses. All control mFDR, which is the ratio of the expected number of false rejections to the expected number of rejections. mFDR is a weaker criterion than the false discovery rate, which is the expected value of the ratio. We compensate for this weakness by showing that α-investing controls mFDR at every rejected hypothesis. α-investing resembles α-spending that is used in sequential trials, but it has a key difference. When a test rejects a null hypothesis, α-investing earns additional probability towards subsequent tests. α-investing hence allows us to incorporate domain knowledge into the testing procedure and to improve the power of the tests. In this way, α-investing enables the statistician to design a testing procedure for a specific problem while guaranteeing control of mFDR.},

	abstract = {Abstract Multiple testing (MT) with false discovery rate (FDR) control has been widely conducted in the ``discrete paradigm'' where p-values have discrete and heterogeneous null distributions. However, in this scenario existing FDR procedures often lose some power and may yield unreliable inference, and for this scenario there does not seem to be an FDR procedure that partitions hypotheses into groups, employs data-adaptive weights and is nonasymptotically conservative. We propose a weighted p-value-based FDR procedure, ``weighted FDR (wFDR) procedure'' for short, for MT in the discrete paradigm that efficiently adapts to both heterogeneity and discreteness of p-value distributions. We theoretically justify the nonasymptotic conservativeness of the wFDR procedure under independence, and show via simulation studies that, for MT based on p-values of binomial test or Fisher's exact test, it is more powerful than six other procedures. The wFDR procedure is applied to two examples based on discrete data, a drug safety study, and a differential methylation study, where it makes more discoveries than two existing methods.},

	abstract = {Recent pattern mining algorithms such as LAMP allow us to compute statistical significance of patterns with respect to an outcome variable. Their p-values are adjusted to control the family-wise error rate, which is the probability of at least one false discovery occurring. However, they are a poor fit for medical applications, due to their inability to handle potential confounding variables such as age or gender. We propose a novel pattern mining algorithm that evaluates statistical significance under confounding variables. Using a new testability bound based on the exact logistic regression model, the algorithm can exclude a large quantity of combination without testing them, limiting the amount of correction required for multiple testing. Using synthetic data, we showed that our method could remove the bias introduced by confounding variables while still detecting true patterns correlated with the class. In addition, we demonstrated application of data integration using a confounding variable.}}
