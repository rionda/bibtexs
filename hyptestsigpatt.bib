	abstract = {α-investing is an adaptive sequential methodology that encompasses a large family of procedures for testing multiple hypotheses. All control mFDR, which is the ratio of the expected number of false rejections to the expected number of rejections. mFDR is a weaker criterion than the false discovery rate, which is the expected value of the ratio. We compensate for this weakness by showing that α-investing controls mFDR at every rejected hypothesis. α-investing resembles α-spending that is used in sequential trials, but it has a key difference. When a test rejects a null hypothesis, α-investing earns additional probability towards subsequent tests. α-investing hence allows us to incorporate domain knowledge into the testing procedure and to improve the power of the tests. In this way, α-investing enables the statistician to design a testing procedure for a specific problem while guaranteeing control of mFDR.},

	abstract = {Abstract Multiple testing (MT) with false discovery rate (FDR) control has been widely conducted in the ``discrete paradigm'' where p-values have discrete and heterogeneous null distributions. However, in this scenario existing FDR procedures often lose some power and may yield unreliable inference, and for this scenario there does not seem to be an FDR procedure that partitions hypotheses into groups, employs data-adaptive weights and is nonasymptotically conservative. We propose a weighted p-value-based FDR procedure, ``weighted FDR (wFDR) procedure'' for short, for MT in the discrete paradigm that efficiently adapts to both heterogeneity and discreteness of p-value distributions. We theoretically justify the nonasymptotic conservativeness of the wFDR procedure under independence, and show via simulation studies that, for MT based on p-values of binomial test or Fisher's exact test, it is more powerful than six other procedures. The wFDR procedure is applied to two examples based on discrete data, a drug safety study, and a differential methylation study, where it makes more discoveries than two existing methods.},

	abstract = {Recent pattern mining algorithms such as LAMP allow us to compute statistical significance of patterns with respect to an outcome variable. Their p-values are adjusted to control the family-wise error rate, which is the probability of at least one false discovery occurring. However, they are a poor fit for medical applications, due to their inability to handle potential confounding variables such as age or gender. We propose a novel pattern mining algorithm that evaluates statistical significance under confounding variables. Using a new testability bound based on the exact logistic regression model, the algorithm can exclude a large quantity of combination without testing them, limiting the amount of correction required for multiple testing. Using synthetic data, we showed that our method could remove the bias introduced by confounding variables while still detecting true patterns correlated with the class. In addition, we demonstrated application of data integration using a confounding variable.}}
