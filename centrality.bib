	year = {2017},
	abstract = {Betweenness centrality quantifies the importance of graph nodes in a variety of applications including social, biological and communication networks. Its computation is very costly for large graphs; therefore, many approximate methods have been proposed. Given the lack of a golden standard, the accuracy of most approximate methods is evaluated on tiny graphs and is not guaranteed to be representative of realistic datasets that are orders of magnitude larger. In this paper, we develop BeBeCA, a benchmark for betweenness centrality approximation methods on large graphs. Specifically: (i) We generate a golden standard by deploying a parallel implementation of Brandes algorithm using 96,000 CPU cores on a supercomputer to compute exact betweenness centrality values for several large graphs with up to 126M edges. (ii) We propose an evaluation methodology to assess various aspects of approximation accuracy, such as average error and quality of node ranking. (iii) We survey a large number of existing approximation methods and compare their performance and accuracy using our benchmark. (iv) We publicly share our benchmark, which includes the golden standard exact betweenness centrality values together with the scripts that implement our evaluation methodology; for researchers to compare their own algorithms and practitioners to select the appropriate algorithm for their application and data.},

	abstract = {In this paper, first given a directed network G and a vertex {\$}{\$}r {\backslash}in V(G){\$}{\$}r∈V(G), we propose a new exact algorithm to compute betweenness score of r. Our algorithm pre-computes a set {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal {\{}RF{\}}(r){\$}{\$}RF(r), which is used to prune a huge amount of computations that do not contribute in the betweenness score of r. Then, for the cases where {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal {\{}RF{\}}(r){\$}{\$}RF(r)is large, we present a randomized algorithm that samples from {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal {\{}RF{\}}(r){\$}{\$}RF(r)and performs computations for only the sampled elements. We show that this algorithm provides an {\$}{\$}({\backslash}epsilon ,{\backslash}delta ){\$}{\$}(ϵ,$\delta$)-approximation of the betweenness score of r. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithms and show that they significantly outperform the most efficient existing algorithms, in terms of both running time and accuracy. Our experiments also show that our proposed algorithms can effectively compute betweenness scores of all vertices in a set of vertices.}}

	abstract = {Betweenness is a well-known centrality measure that ranks the nodes of a network according to their participation in shortest paths. Since an exact computation is prohibitive in large networks, several approximation algorithms have been proposed. Besides that, recent years have seen the publication of dynamic algorithms for efficient recomputation of betweenness in networks that change over time. In this paper we propose the first betweenness centrality approximation algorithms with a provable guarantee on the maximum approximation error for dynamic networks. Several new intermediate algorithmic results contribute to the respective approximation algorithms: (i) new upper bounds on the vertex diameter, (ii) the first fully-dynamic algorithm for updating an approximation of the vertex diameter in undirected graphs, and (iii) an algorithm with lower time complexity for updating single-source shortest paths in unweighted graphs after a batch of edge actions. Using approximation, our algorithms are the first to make in-memory computation of betweenness in dynamic networks with millions of edges feasible. Our experiments show that our algorithms can achieve substantial speedups compared to recomputation, up to several orders of magnitude. Moreover, the approximation accuracy is usually significantly better than the theoretical guarantee in terms of absolute error. More importantly, for reasonably small approximation error thresholds, the rank of nodes is well preserved, in particular for nodes with high betweenness.},

To date, the best known exact and centralized algorithm for this task is an algorithm proposed in 2001 by Brandes. The contribution of our paper is Brandes++, an algorithm for exact efficient computation of betweenness centrality. The crux of our algorithm is that we create a sketch of the graph, that we call the skeleton, by replacing subgraphs with simpler graph structures. Depending on the underlying graph structure, using this skeleton and by keeping appropriate summaries Brandes++ we can achieve significantly low running times in our computations. Extensive experimental evaluation on real life datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm for different types of graphs. We release our code for benefit of the research community.},

	abstract = {One response to the proliferation of large datasets has been to develop ingenious ways to throw resources at the problem, using massive fault tolerant storage architectures, parallel and graphical computation models such as MapReduce, Pregel and Giraph. However, not all environments can support this scale of resources, and not all queries need an exact response. This motivates the use of sampling to generate summary datasets that support rapid queries, and prolong the useful life of the data in storage. To be effective, sampling must mediate the tensions between resource constraints, data characteristics, and the required query accuracy. The state-of-the-art in sampling goes far beyond simple uniform selection of elements, to maximize the usefulness of the resulting sample. This tutorial reviews progress in sample design for large datasets, including streaming and graph-structured data. Applications are discussed to sampling network traffic and social networks. }}
