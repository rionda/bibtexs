	Abstract = {Mining high-utility itemsets (HUIs) in transactional databases has become a very popular research topic in recent years. A popular variation of the problem of HUI mining is to discover high average-utility itemsets (HAUIs), where an alternative measure called the average-utility is used to evaluate the utility of itemsets by considering their lengths. Albeit, HAUI mining has been studied extensively, current algorithms often consume a large amount of memory and have long execution times, due to the large search space and the usage of loose upper bounds to estimate the average-utilities of itemsets. In this paper, we present a more efficient algorithm for HAUI mining, which includes three pruning strategies to provide a tighter upper bound on the average-utilities of itemsets, and thus reduce the search space more effectively to decrease the runtime. The first pruning strategy utilizes relationships between item pairs to reduce the search space for itemsets containing three or more items. The second pruning strategy provides a tighter upper bound on the average-utilities of itemsets to prune unpromising candidates early. The third strategy reduces the time for constructing the average-utility-list structures for itemsets, which is used to calculate their upper bounds. Substantial experiments conducted on both real-life and synthetic datasets show that the proposed algorithm with three pruning strategies can efficiently and effectively reduce the search space for mining HAUIs, when compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms, in terms of runtime, number of candidates, memory usage, performance of the pruning strategies and scalability.},

	Abstract = {With the ever increasing number of applications of data mining, high-utility itemset mining (HUIM) has become a critical issue in recent decades. In traditional HUIM, the utility of an itemset is defined as the sum of the utilities of its items, in transactions where it appears. An important problem with this definition is that it does not take itemset length into account. Because the utility of larger itemset is generally greater than the utility of smaller itemset, traditional HUIM algorithms tend to be biased toward finding a set of large itemsets. Thus, this definition is not a fair measurement of utility. To provide a better assessment of each itemset's utility, the task of high average-utility itemset mining (HAUIM) was proposed. It introduces the average utility measure, which considers both the length of itemsets and their utilities, and is thus more appropriate in real-world situations. Several algorithms have been designed for this task. They can be generally categorized as either level-wise or pattern-growth approaches. Both of them require, however, the amount of computation to find the actual high average-utility itemsets (HAUIs). In this paper, we present an efficient average-utility (AU)-list structure to discover the HAUIs more efficiently. A depth-first search algorithm named HAUI-Miner is proposed to explore the search space without candidate generation, and an efficient pruning strategy is developed to reduce the search space and speed up the mining process. Extensive experiments are conducted to compare the performance of HAUI-Miner with the state-of-the-art HAUIM algorithms in terms of runtime, number of determining nodes, memory usage and scalability.},

	Year = {2016},
	Abstract = {Discovering statistically significant patterns from databases is an important challenging problem. The main obstacle of this problem is in the difficulty of taking into account the selection bias, i.e., the bias arising from the fact that patterns are selected from extremely large number of candidates in databases. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for predictive pattern mining problems that can address the selection bias issue. Our approach is built on a recently popularized statistical inference framework called selective inference. In selective inference, statistical inferences (such as statistical hypothesis testing) are conducted based on sampling distributions conditional on a selection event. If the selection event is characterized in a tractable way, statistical inferences can be made without minding selection bias issue. However, in pattern mining problems, it is difficult to characterize the entire selection process of mining algorithms. Our main contribution in this paper is to solve this challenging problem for a class of predictive pattern mining problems by introducing a novel algorithmic framework. We demonstrate that our approach is useful for finding statistically significant patterns from databases.},

	Abstract = {More than three transcription factors often work together to enable cells to respond to various signals. The detection of combinatorial regulation by multiple transcription factors, however, is not only computationally nontrivial but also extremely unlikely because of multiple testing correction. The exponential growth in the number of tests forces us to set a strict limit on the maximum arity. Here, we propose an efficient branch-and-bound algorithm called the ``limitless arity multiple-testing procedure'' (LAMP) to count the exact number of testable combinations and calibrate the Bonferroni factor to the smallest possible value. LAMP lists significant combinations without any limit, whereas the family-wise error rate is rigorously controlled under the threshold. In the human breast cancer transcriptome, LAMP discovered statistically significant combinations of as many as eight binding motifs. This method may contribute to uncover pathways regulated in a coordinated fashion and find hidden associations in heterogeneous data.},

	Abstract = {Given a database, computing the fraction of rows that contain a query itemset or determining whether this fraction is above some threshold are fundamental operations in data mining. A uniform sample of rows is a good sketch of the database in the sense that all sufficiently frequent itemsets and their approximate frequencies are recoverable from the sample, and the sketch size is independent of the number of rows in the original database. For many seemingly similar problems there are better sketching algorithms than uniform sampling. In this paper we show that for itemset frequency sketching this is not the case. That is, we prove that there exist classes of databases for which uniform sampling is a space optimal sketch for approximate itemset frequency analysis, up to constant or iterated-logarithmic factors.},
