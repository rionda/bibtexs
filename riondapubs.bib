us to compute upper bounds to the maximum deviation of sample means from their expectations,
thus it can be used to find both statistically-significant functions (i.e., patterns)

of collections of high-expectation functions (e.g., frequent patterns) when the available
data is a small sample from a large dataset. This feature is a strong improvement
over previously proposed solutions that could only achieve one of the two. MCRapper
uses upper bounds to the discrepancy of the functions to efficiently explore and prune
the search space, a technique borrowed from pattern mining itself. To show the practical
use of MCRapper, we employ it to develop an algorithm TFP-R for the task of True Frequent
Pattern (TFP) mining. TFP-R gives guarantees on the probability of including any false
positives (precision) and exhibits higher statistical power (recall) than existing
methods offering the same guarantees. We evaluate MCRapper and TFP-R and show that
they outperform the state-of-the-art for their respective tasks.},

	abstract = {We study the problem of graph summarization. Given a large graph we aim at producing a concise lossy representation (a summary) that can be stored in main memory and used to approximately answer queries about the original graph much faster than by using the exact representation. In this work we study a very natural type of summary: the original set of vertices is partitioned into a small number of supernodes connected by superedges to form a complete weighted graph. The superedge weights are the edge densities between vertices in the corresponding supernodes. To quantify the dissimilarity between the original graph and a summary, we adopt the reconstruction error and the cut-norm error. By exposing a connection between graph summarization and geometric clustering problems (i.e., k-means and k-median), we develop the first polynomial-time approximation algorithms to compute the best possible summary of a certain size under both measures. We discuss how to use our summaries to store a (lossy or lossless) compressed graph representation and to approximately answer a large class of queries about the original graph, including adjacency, degree, eigenvector centrality, and triangle and subgraph counting. Using the summary to answer queries is very efficient as the running time to compute the answer depends on the number of supernodes in the summary, rather than the number of nodes in the original graph.},

Waiting for GodotGiven a labeled graph, the collection of k-vertex induced connected
subgraph patterns that appear in the graph more frequently than a user-specified minimum
threshold provides a compact summary of the characteristics of the graph, and finds
applications ranging from biology to network science. However, finding these patterns
is challenging, even more so for dynamic graphs that evolve over time, due to the
streaming nature of the input and the exponential time complexity of the problem.
We study this task in both incremental and fully-dynamic streaming settings, where
arbitrary edges can be added or removed from the graph. We present TipTap, a suite
of algorithms to compute high-quality approximations of the frequent k-vertex subgraphs
w.r.t.&nbsp;a given threshold, at any time (i.e., point of the stream), with high probability.
In contrast to existing state-of-the-art solutions that require iterating over the
entire set of subgraphs in the vicinity of the updated edge, TipTap operates by efficiently
maintaining a uniform sample of connected k-vertex subgraphs, thanks to an optimized
neighborhood-exploration procedure. We provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed
algorithms in terms of their unbiasedness and of the sample size needed to obtain
a desired approximation quality. Our analysis relies on sample-complexity bounds that
use Vapnik--Chervonenkis dimension, a key concept from statistical learning theory,
which allows us to derive a sufficient sample size that is independent from the size
of the graph. The results of our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TipTap returns
high-quality results more efficiently and accurately than existing baselines.},

CaDET uses the empirical cross entropy impurity criterion for tree growth, which incentivizes splits that improve predictive accuracy more than the regression criteria or estimated mean-integrated-square-error used in previous works. CaDET also admits more efficient training and query procedures than existing tree-based CDE approaches, and stores only a bounded amount of information at each tree leaf, by using sufficient statistics for all computations. Previous tree-based CDE techniques produce complicated uninterpretable distribution objects, whereas CaDET may be instantiated with easily interpretable distribution families, making every part of the model easy to understand. Our experimental evaluation on real datasets shows that CaDET usually learns more accurate, smaller, and more interpretable models, and is less prone to overfitting than existing tree-based CDE approaches.},

	abstract = {Betweenness centrality is a fundamental measure in social network analysis, expressing the importance or influence of individual vertices (or edges) in a network in terms of the fraction of shortest paths that pass through them. Since exact computation in large networks is prohibitively expensive, we present two efficient randomized algorithms for betweenness estimation. The algorithms are based on random sampling of shortest paths and offer probabilistic guarantees on the quality of the approximation. The first algorithm estimates the betweenness of all vertices (or edges): all approximate values are within an additive factor \$\${\backslash}varepsilon {\backslash}in (0,1)\$\$ $\epsilon$ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) from the real values, with probability at least \$\$1-{\backslash}delta \$\$ 1 - $\delta$ . The second algorithm focuses on the top-K vertices (or edges) with highest betweenness and estimate their betweenness value to within a multiplicative factor \$\${\backslash}varepsilon \$\$ $\epsilon$ , with probability at least \$\$1-{\backslash}delta \$\$ 1 - $\delta$ . This is the first algorithm that can compute such approximation for the top-K vertices (or edges). By proving upper and lower bounds to the VC-dimension of a range set associated with the problem at hand, we can bound the sample size needed to achieve the desired approximations. We obtain sample sizes that are independent from the number of vertices in the network and only depend on a characteristic quantity that we call the vertex-diameter, that is the maximum number of vertices in a shortest path. In some cases, the sample size is completely independent from any quantitative property of the graph. An extensive experimental evaluation on real and artificial networks shows that our algorithms are significantly faster and much more scalable as the number of vertices grows than other algorithms with similar approximation guarantees.},
