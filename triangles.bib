	year = {2015},
	abstract = {Distributed data processing platforms such as MapReduce and Pregel have substantially simplified the design and deployment of certain classes of distributed graph analytics algorithms. However, these platforms do not represent a good match for distributed graph mining problems, as for example finding frequent subgraphs in a graph. Given an input graph, these problems require exploring a very large number of subgraphs and finding patterns that match some "interestingness" criteria desired by the user. These algorithms are very important for areas such as social networks, semantic web, and bioinformatics.In this paper, we present Arabesque, the first distributed data processing platform for implementing graph mining algorithms. Arabesque automates the process of exploring a very large number of subgraphs. It defines a high-level filter-process computational model that simplifies the development of scalable graph mining algorithms: Arabesque explores subgraphs and passes them to the application, which must simply compute outputs and decide whether the subgraph should be further extended. We use Arabesque's API to produce distributed solutions to three fundamental graph mining problems: frequent subgraph mining, counting motifs, and finding cliques. Our implementations require a handful of lines of code, scale to trillions of subgraphs, and represent in some cases the first available distributed solutions.},

Therefore the variances of estimators of totals of all the variables of interest are reduced, depending on the correlations of these variables with the controlled variables. In this paper, we develop a general method, called the cube method, for selecting approximately balanced samples with equal or unequal inclusion probabilities and any number of auxiliary variables.},

	title = {Triangle Counting in Dynamic Graph Streams},
	volume = {76},
	year = {2016},
	abstract = {Estimating the number of triangles in graph streams using a limited amount of memory has become a popular topic in the last decade. Different variations of the problem have been studied, depending on whether the graph edges are provided in an arbitrary order or as incidence lists. However, with a few exceptions, the algorithms have considered insert-only streams. We present a new algorithm estimating the number of triangles in dynamic graph streams where edges can be both inserted and deleted. We show that our algorithm achieves better time and space complexity than previous solutions for various graph classes, for example sparse graphs with a relatively small number of triangles. Also, for graphs with constant transitivity coefficient, a common situation in real graphs, this is the first algorithm achieving constant processing time per edge. The result is achieved by a novel approach combining sampling of vertex triples and sparsification of the input graph. In the course of the analysis of the algorithm we present a lower bound on the number of pairwise independent 2-paths in general graphs which might be of independent interest. At the end of the paper we discuss lower bounds on the space complexity of triangle counting algorithms that make no assumptions on the structure of the graph.},
