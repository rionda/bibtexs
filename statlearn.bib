Upper bounds on the approximation error are derived that depend on the Rademacher complexities of the families. The estimates exploit possible relationships among the components of the multivariable vector-valued functions. All such components are approximated simultaneously in such a way to use, for a desired approximation accuracy, less computational units than those required by componentwise approximation. An application to                                                                         -stage optimization problems is discussed.},

	abstract = {Popular approaches to differential privacy, such as the Laplace and exponential mechanisms, calibrate randomised smoothing through global sensitivity of the target non-private function. Bounding such sensitivity is often a prohibitively complex analytic calculation. As an alternative, we propose a straightforward sampler for estimating sensitivity of non-private mechanisms. Since our sensitivity estimates hold with high probability, any mechanism that would be $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differentially private under bounded global sensitivity automatically achieves $(\epsilon,\delta,\gamma)$-random differential privacy (Hall et al. 2012), without any target-specific calculations required. We demonstrate on worked example learners how our usable approach adopts a naturally-relaxed privacy guarantee, while achieving more accurate releases even for non-private functions that are black-box computer programs.},

	abstract = {Previous works in literature showed that performance estimations of learning procedures can be characterized by a convergence rate ranging between {\$}{\$}O(n^{\{}-1{\}}){\$}{\$} O ( n - 1 ) (fast rate) and {\$}{\$}O(n^{\{}-{\{}1{\}}/{\{}2{\}}{\}}){\$}{\$} O ( n - 1 / 2 ) (slow rate). In order to derive such result, some assumptions on the problem are required; moreover, even when convergence is fast, the constants characterizing the bounds are often quite loose. In this work, we prove new Rademacher complexity (RC) based bounds, which do not require any additional assumptions for achieving a fast convergence rate {\$}{\$}O(n^{\{}-1{\}}){\$}{\$} O ( n - 1 ) in the optimistic case and a slow rate {\$}{\$}O(n^{\{}-{\{}1{\}}/{\{}2{\}}{\}}){\$}{\$} O ( n - 1 / 2 ) in the general case. At the same time, they are characterized by smaller constants with respect to other state-of-the-art RC fast converging alternatives in literature. The results proposed in this work are obtained by exploiting the fundamental work of Talagrand on concentration inequalities for product measures and empirical processes. As a further issue, we also provide the extension of the results to the semi-supervised learning framework, showing how additional unlabeled samples allow improving the tightness of the derived bound.},

The statistical theory of learning and generalization concerns the problem of choosing desired functions on the basis of empirical data. Highly applicable to a variety of computer science and robotics fields, this book offers lucid coverage of the theory as a whole. Presenting a method for determining the necessary and sufficient conditions for consistency of learning process, the author covers function estimates from small data pools, applying these estimations to real-life problems, and much more.}},
